# Flakvest
This is a new project, and my first significantly scoped open source project, please be patient. =)

Flakvest is intended as a replacement for RANCID, to be easily extendable, and support some crazier concepts and tools.

Major components:
Expect wrapper for telnet/ssh.
Output parser for Expect wrapper, turns collected data into JSON objects for use in code for automation or development

Future:
SNMP Collector
Syslog Analyzer

Perl module requirements:
Expect
Search::ElasticSearch
JSON
JSON::XS
